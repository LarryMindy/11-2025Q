  {
  question: "Who wrote the song 'Respect' made famous by Aretha Franklin?",
  options: ["Otis Redding", "Aretha Franklin", "Ted White", "Sam Cooke"],
  answer: 0,
  explanation: "Aretha Franklin wrote many of her own songs, sometimes in collaboration with her husband Ted White, but though she did not write 'Respect,' she completely transformed it from an Otis Redding original into her own signature anthem. Redding wrote and released the song in 1965 as a man asking for respect, but Franklin's 1967 version, which she re-arranged, added iconic call-and-response vocals with her sisters, and famously spelled out 'R-E-S-P-E-C-T,' made it a powerful statement for the Civil Rights and feminist movements."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the English lyrics to 'My Way' made famous by Frank Sinatra?",
  options: ["Neil Sedaka", "Barry Mann", "Paul Anka", "Frank Sinatra"],
  answer: 2,
  explanation: "‘My Way’ began as a French song called ‘Comme d’habitude,’ composed by Claude François and Jacques Revaux. Paul Anka heard it while in Paris, bought the rights, and rewrote the lyrics entirely for Frank Sinatra. Anka tailored the song to reflect Sinatra’s persona and career, turning it into one of his most iconic performances."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the lyrics to 'Take Me Home, Country Roads'?",
  options: ["John Denver", "Barry Mann", "Johnny Cash", "Bill Danoff & Taffy Nivert"],
  answer: 3,
  explanation: "Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert wrote the bulk of the song and brought it to John Denver, who helped finish it and recorded the hit version. Though Denver is closely associated with the song, the lyricists were the ones who crafted its nostalgic imagery of West Virginia."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the lyrics to 'Stairway to Heaven'?",
  options: ["Randy California", "Robert Plant", "John Paul Jones", "Jimmy Page"],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: "Robert Plant wrote the lyrics to ‘Stairway to Heaven,’ while Jimmy Page composed the music. Randy California, guitarist for the band Spirit, wrote a song called ‘Taurus’ that some claimed inspired the opening guitar riff. A lawsuit followed, but the courts ultimately ruled in Led Zeppelin’s favor, stating the similarity wasn’t substantial enough to constitute plagiarism."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the lyrics to 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine'?",
  options: ["Otis Redding", "Norman Whitfield, Barrett Strong", "Marvin Gaye", "Sam Cooke"],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: "Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong wrote this Motown classic, which was first recorded by Gladys Knight & the Pips and later became a massive hit for Marvin Gaye. The song’s theme of suspicion and heartbreak resonated across generations."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the lyrics to 'Brown Eyed Girl'?",
  options: ["Jim Morrison", "Barry Mann", "Van Morrison", "Neil Diamond"],
  answer: 2,
  explanation: "Van Morrison wrote and performed ‘Brown Eyed Girl’ in 1967. It was originally titled ‘Brown-Skinned Girl,’ but the name was changed during production. The song became his breakout hit and remains one of the most enduring tracks of the era."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the lyrics to 'Me and Bobby McGee'?",
  options: ["Willie Nelson", "Janis Joplin", "Kris Kristofferson", "Bob Dylan"],
  answer: 2,
  explanation: "Kris Kristofferson wrote ‘Me and Bobby McGee,’ and Janis Joplin’s posthumous recording turned it into a classic. The song’s themes of freedom, loss, and the open road made it a defining anthem of the counterculture era."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the lyrics to 'Light My Fire'?",
  options: ["Van Morrison", "Jim Morrison", "Robby Krieger", "Ray Manzarek"],
  answer: 2,
  explanation: "Robby Krieger, guitarist for The Doors, wrote the lyrics to ‘Light My Fire.’ Though Jim Morrison was the band’s frontman and lyricist for many songs, Krieger penned this one, which became their first major hit. And no, Jim Morrison and Van Morrison are not related. The confusion likely comes from their shared last name, but they are from different families. Jim Morrison was born in Florida, the son of a U.S. Navy Rear Admiral. Van Morrison was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to working-class Protestant parents of Ulster Scots descent."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the lyrics to 'I’m a Believer'?",
  options: ["Neil Diamond", "John Lennon", "Micky Dolenz", "Paul Simon"],
  answer: 0,
  explanation: "Neil Diamond wrote ‘I’m a Believer,’ which became a huge hit for The Monkees in 1966. Micky Dolenz sang lead vocals, and the song topped charts around the world, helping launch Diamond’s career as a songwriter."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the lyrics to 'Red Red Wine'?",
  options: ["Bono", "Neil Diamond", "Alistair Ian Campbell", "Duncan Campbell"],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: "Neil Diamond wrote and recorded ‘Red Red Wine’ in 1967 as a slow ballad. UB40’s reggae cover in 1983 gave it new life and international fame. The Campbell brothers performed the hit version, but Diamond’s lyrics remained intact."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the lyrics to 'You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman'?",
  options: ["Ted White", "Carole King, Gerry Goffin, Jerry Wexler", "Dolly Parton", "Barry Mann"],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: "Carole King and Gerry Goffin wrote the lyrics, with producer Jerry Wexler contributing the title idea. Aretha Franklin’s powerful performance turned it into a soul anthem. The song was later covered by King herself and others, but Franklin’s version remains definitive."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the lyrics to 'Here You Come Again'?",
  options: ["Gary Klein", "Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil", "Dolly Parton", "Neil Sedaka"],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: "Dolly Parton has written between 3000–5000 songs during her career. But this one was not one of them. It was written by the songwriting couple Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, who were very prolific and wrote many hits for other singers, like The Righteous Brothers (‘You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’), The Drifters (‘On Broadway’), and Paul Revere & the Raiders (‘Kicks’)."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the lyrics to 'Crazy' made famous by Patsy Cline?",
  options: ["Kris Kristofferson", "Willie Nelson", "Patsy Cline", "Roger Miller"],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: "Willie Nelson wrote ‘Crazy’ early in his career, and Patsy Cline’s recording turned it into a timeless country classic. The song’s jazzy phrasing and emotional depth helped establish Nelson as a major songwriting talent."
},
{
  question: "Who wrote the lyrics to 'Angel of the Morning'?",
  options: ["Evie Sands", "Chip Taylor", "Juice Newton", "Merrilee Rush"],

  answer: 0,
  explanation: "‘Always on My Mind’ was written by Wayne Carson, Johnny Christopher, and Mark James. It was first recorded by Brenda Lee, then Elvis Presley, and later became a signature hit for Willie Nelson. The song’s tender regret and emotional honesty made it a favorite across genres."
},
{
  question: "Bonus question: Chip Taylor is mentioned in one of the above questions. WHO IS/WAS HIS FAMOUS SIBLING?",
  options: ["Neil Armstrong", "Jon Voight", "James Taylor", "Elizabeth Taylor"],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: "Chip Taylor is the brother of actor Jon Voight, making him the uncle of actress Angelina Jolie and actor James Haven. Taylor’s own career as a songwriter includes hits like ‘Wild Thing’ and ‘Angel of the Morning,’ proving that talent runs deep in the family."
